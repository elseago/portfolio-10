In this portfolio I was very interested in maps again. I used a training I found online on how to make maps using tmap rather than the ggplot version. I went through the training first (it gave direct code for different things) and then tried to extend what I learned onto new data sets. However, I had a lot of trouble adding in new variables. I'll need to do some more work to figure out how to do that.

```{r map_packages}
library(sf)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
library(spData)
library(spDataLarge)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r interactive_maps}
library(tmap)    # for static and interactive maps
library(leaflet) # for interactive maps
library(ggplot2) 
library(mapview)
```


```{r}
# Add fill layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill() 
# Add border layer to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_borders() 
# Add fill and border layers to nz shape
tm_shape(nz) +
  tm_fill() +
  tm_borders() 
```


```{r}
map_nz = tm_shape(nz) + tm_polygons()
class(map_nz)
#> [1] "tmap"
```


```{r}
map_nz1 = map_nz +
  tm_shape(nz_elev) + tm_raster(alpha = 0.7)

map_nz1
```


```{r}
urb_1970_2030 = urban_agglomerations %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(1970, 1990, 2010, 2030))

tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(urb_1970_2030) +
  tm_symbols(col = "black", border.col = "white", size = "population_millions") +
  tm_facets(by = "year", nrow = 2, free.coords = FALSE)
```

For some reason this gif did not work. I can't figure out where I am going wrong.

```{r}

urb_anim = tm_shape(world) +
  tm_polygons() +
  tm_shape(urb_1970_2030) +
  tm_symbols(col = "black", border.col = "white", size = "population_millions") +
  tm_facets(along = "year", free.coords = FALSE)

tmap_animation(urb_anim, filename = "urb_anim2.gif", width = 5 , height = 5 , delay = 25)
```


```{r}
urb_anim = tm_shape(world) + tm_polygons() + 
  tm_shape(urban_agglomerations) + tm_dots(size = "population_millions") +
  tm_facets(along = "year", free.coords = FALSE)

tmap_animation(urb_anim, filename = "urb_anim.gif", delay = 25)
```





```{r}

```{r}
library(mapdeck)
set_token(Sys.getenv("MAPBOX"))
crash_data = read.csv("https://git.io/geocompr-mapdeck")
crash_data = na.omit(crash_data)
ms = mapdeck_style("dark")
mapdeck(style = ms, pitch = 45, location = c(0, 52), zoom = 4) %>%
add_grid(data = crash_data, lat = "lat", lon = "lng", cell_size = 1000,
         elevation_scale = 50, layer_id = "grid_layer",
         colour_range = viridisLite::plasma(6))
```


```{r}
library(shiny)    # for shiny apps
library(leaflet)  # renderLeaflet function
library(spData)   # loads the world dataset 
ui = fluidPage(
  sliderInput(inputId = "life", "Life expectancy", 49, 84, value = 80),
      leafletOutput(outputId = "map")
  )
server = function(input, output) {
  output$map = renderLeaflet({
    leaflet() %>% 
      # addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite") %>%
      addPolygons(data = world[world$lifeExp < input$life, ])})
}

```
